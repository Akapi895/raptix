"""Network Reconnaissance Tools for Raptix.

This module provides network reconnaissance capabilities including:
- Network scanning and service discovery
- Port scanning and vulnerability detection
- Network topology mapping
- Protocol-specific reconnaissance
- Network inventory and asset discovery

All network operations are designed to be:
- Non-intrusive (read-only by default)
- Rate-limited to avoid detection
- RoE (Rules of Engagement) compliant
- Scope-restricted to authorized targets only
